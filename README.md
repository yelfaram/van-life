# Scrimba - Travel Van Rental
This is my solution to the [VanLife project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6)

## Overview
An app for renting decked-out travel vans for your next road trip adventure

### Concepts
Through this project, I will be able to reinforce my knowledge of React Router 6.

Some of the concepts I've learned about include:
- BrowserRouter
- Link/NavLink
- Route
    - params, nesting, index
- Outlet
    - context

## React + Vite
This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
